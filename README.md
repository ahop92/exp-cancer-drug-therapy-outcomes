## Background 

One script was developed to evaluate tumor volume outcomes for different drug regimens in a cancer study. The study was performed on male and female (biological sex) mice.

### Mice Cancer Study Code Functionality

Each section of code pulls from a merged form of the meta data and study data in order to evaluate the following: 

1. Amount of tumor measurements completed per drug regimen
2. Distribution of biological sex within the study. 
3. Outlier analysis for the four most promising drug types 
4. Correlation between weight and tumor volume for one of the strongest drug candidates

### Results 

1. For mice treated with Capomulin, there is a strong correlation between weight and tumor volume. As The weight of the 
mouse increases, so too does the tumor volume. 

2. Given that a near equal percentage of male and female (biological sex) mice were evaluated, the results of the study 
are not restricted to one biological sex and can be applied to the two present. 

3. For the four most promising drugs in the study, there were no outliers present that swayed the analysis which 
indicates a strong consistency in their results.
